# ECMAScript 2016 (ES7)

## Array.prototype.includes()

This feature introduces a more readable syntax for checking if an array contains an element.

With ES6 and lower, to check if an array contained an element you had to use `indexOf`, which checks the index in the array, and returns `-1` if the element is not there.

With this feature introduced in ES7 we can do

```js
if (![1, 2].includes(3)) {
  console.log("Not found");
}
```

## Exponentiation Operator

The exponentiation operator `**` is the equivalent of `Math.pow()`, but brought into the language instead of being a library function.

```js
Math.pow(4, 2) == 4 ** 2;
```
