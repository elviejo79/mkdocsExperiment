# Caching using Struct

You create a `struct` that will hold the closure and the resulting value of calling the closure. The `struct` will execute the closure only if we need the resulting value, and it will cache the resulting value so the rest of our code doesnâ€™t have to be responsible for saving and reusing the result.

## Simple implementation

```rust
struct Cacher<T>
    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32
{
    calculation: T,
    last: Option<u32>,
    value: Option<u32>,
}
```

Now you add methods to initialize this cache and to retrieve the value:

```rust
impl<T> Cacher<T>
    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32
{
    fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T> {
        Cacher {
            calculation,
            last: 0, // value at start didn't matter
            value: None,
        }
    }

    fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {
        // check if argument changed and use only store if last call was the same
        if self.last != Some(v) {
            self.last = Some(v);
            self.value = None;
        }
        match self.value {
            Some(v) && => v,
            None => {
                let v = (self.calculation)(arg);
                self.value = Some(v);
                v
            },
        }
    }
}
```

And it should be called like:

```rust
let incrementor = Cacher::new(|a| a + 1);
let x = incrementor.value(5); // x will be 6
```
